# What is OOP?
# OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

# Python is an object-oriented language, allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better organization and reusability.




# Advantages of OOP


# Provides a clear structure to programs
# Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
# Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
# Allows you to build reusable applications with less code


# Tip: The DRY principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once. Move repeated code into functions or classes and reuse it.


# ðŸ‘‰ In short:
# OOP = Data (variables) + Behavior (functions) together in one unit (object)

# It makes code:

# Easier to understand

# Reusable

# Scalable

# Maintainable

# Class.    	Blueprint	    class	              class Student:
# Object	Instance of class	Variable = Class()	s1 = Student()
# Constructor	Initializes object	 __init__()	
# Destructor	Destroys object	__del__()	
# Encapsulation	Data hiding	__var, getters/setters	
# Abstraction	Hiding internal details	ABC, @abstractmethod	
# Inheritance	Reuse parent code	class B(A)	
# Polymorphism	Same name, different behavior	Method overriding
